## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2021-03-30

## Changed

- Relaxed bounds on Molecule to allow allow all versions < v4 ([#27](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-hetznercloud/pull/27))

## [1.0.0] - 2021-01-06

This is a major release with breaking changes for your schema and support for a
new major version of Molecule. If you use the `volumes:` key in your
`molecule.yml` then this change will break your configuration. Please see the
section on "Volume Handling" in the README.md on how to upgrade successfully.
You will now need to install Ansible yourself as Molecule does not do it for
you. If there are any other breaking changes, please report them on the issue
tracker so that we can mention them here.
